<br/>
The anti-Party actions of the disloyal rebels continue despite our many efforts
and the love of the ordinary citizens for the Party and its benovolent rule.
Our glorious leader Comrade Fer has had an ardous few months dealing with
these foolish rebels and their nefarious plans. The constant interrogations have
proven tiring and he feels the need for the quiet seclusion of the Dacha.

Your job is to ensure he arrives there unmolested. 

Consider it not merely a test of your competence Tovarich, but also of your
loyalty to the Party...
