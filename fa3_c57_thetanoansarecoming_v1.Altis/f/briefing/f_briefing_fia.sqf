<br/>
Tovarich Commander, the enemy has three critical C2 assets which must be
destroyed before the fleet enters radar range for the invasion to succeed. You
have thirty (30) minutes to achieve this objective. At their current speed, the
fleet will be within firing range five (5) minutes later and will
<b>immediately</b> commence the bombardment so it it strongly suggested you
extract before that point.  
<br/><br/>
<font size='18'>MOVEMENT PLAN</font>
<br/>
Command, Alpha and Bravo squads will insert by Wy-55 helicopter from the commandered
FAB in Feres. The Wy-55s will carry additional ammunition and explosives for
Charlie squad.
<br/><br/>
FAC and Charlie squad will perform a HALO drop into the AO and may be used as scouting elements.
They are equipped with chemlights and flareguns to assist in landing operations.
<br/><br/>
All elements will extract by helicopter to Feres. Ferrying may be required.
<br/><br/>
<font size='18'>FIRE SUPPORT PLAN</font>
<br/>
An AH-9 may be available at the FAB for CAS. Due to the covert nature
of the preparation for this mission, it was not possible to arrange for
additional ordanance for the AH-9 so once it has expended its ordanance, it will
cease to have use as a CAS platform.
<br/><br/>
<font size='18'>SPECIAL TASKS</font>
<br/>
FAC will be responsible for coordinating air operations to reduce CO's workload.
FAC will also be responsible for coordination of the final evacuation.

<br/>
Tovarich, the great day is almost upon us! Finally our Altean oppressors shall
taste our boots!
<br/><br/>
But before our invasion fleet can shell their puny AAF military into oblivion,
it must approach to a point where their OTH radar systems could detect it. This
radar must be blinded and you shall be our sharp pointy stick!
<br/><br/>
The OTH system relies on three main radar arrays; each must be destroyed before
the fleet sails into range. This gives you thirty (30) minutes to complete this
great task. The fleet will sail at flank speed into firing range; it will take
them five (5) minutes to close this gap. At that point tovarich, they will
immediately open fire for the good of all our invasion forces. You are strongly
urged to evacuate from the battlefield before this shelling begins. Remember, 
you are a meaningful and valued member of this team and if you should fail to 
evacuate before shelling commences, we will retrieve whatever portion of your 
remains are still solid and return them to your loved ones once the invasion 
is complete!
<br/><br/>
The brave souls in Charlie squad will HALO drop under cover of darkness into the
midst of the enemy and scout out and secure landing zones for the helicopters
that bear their comrades into battle. Charlie will not be able to carry much
ammunition during their difficult parachute insertion, but the helicopters will
carry resupplies for them.
