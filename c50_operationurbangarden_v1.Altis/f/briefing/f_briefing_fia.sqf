<br/>
Tovarich Commander, the enemy has three critical C2 assets which must be
destroyed before the fleet enters radar range for the invasion to succeed. You
have fifteen (15) minutes to achieve this objective. At their current speed, the
fleet will be within firing range five (5) minutes later and will
<b>immediately</b> commence the bombardment so it it strongly suggested you
extract before that point.  
<br/><br/>
<font size='18'>MOVEMENT PLAN</font>
<br/>
CO, Alpha and Bravo squads will insert by Wy-55 helicopter from the commandered
FAB in Feres.
FAC and Charlie squad will HALO drop in and may be used as scouting elements.
All elements will extract by helicopter to Feres. Ferrying may be required.
<br/><br/>
<font size='18'>FIRE SUPPORT PLAN</font>
<br/>
An AH-9 will be available at the FAB for CAS. However due to the covert nature
of the preparation for this mission, it was not possible to arrange for
additional ordanance for the AH-9 so once it has expended its ordanance, it will
cease to have use as a CAS platform.
<br/><br/>
<font size='18'>SPECIAL TASKS</font>
<br/>
FAC will be responsible for coordinating air operations to reduce CO's workload
while conducting the ground operations. FAC will also be responsible for
coordination of the final evacuation.
